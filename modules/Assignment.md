# Assignment for Modules

Create, as a multi-module project, a project with the following files and structure:
- In `sort_by_length.cpp` the main program that prints all lines read from stdin sorted by their length.
- In `sort_string_by_length.cpp` the function that compares strings by length for sorting.
- In `sort_string_by_length.h` the interface to the previous file.
- A `Makefile` that will build this.

You can also perform this assignment in C instead of C++ (but note that this assignment is more difficult in C).
